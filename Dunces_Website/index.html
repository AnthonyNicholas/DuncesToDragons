				<h1>ABOUT</h1>
				<p class="justify">
					In the age of the internet, the tutoring industry is one ripe with opportunity. Many tutoring, Q&A, and forum sites have been built around the concept of the internet’s global connectivity. We plan on using the internet in our company not exactly for this way -- this side of the market is quite saturated already -- but rather to connect people within the same community, and to give them the help that’s there but they might not be able to find otherwise. Our company relies on our three main abilities: adaptability, community-building, and career development. We believe these three abilities differentiates ourselves from the other competitors in this industry. Our adaptability is based on the tutors themselves -- they are students who have taken the same class as the students who want to learn from them, which means they are familiar with the specifics of the class (teachers, homework, etc.) that other universal tutors will not be able to provide. Community-building is based on the locality of the learning -- these tutors and students are within the same school and will be able to develop relationships long after their tutoring sessions. The final ability, career development, is based on us helping the tutors achieve their career goals -- by connecting to prospective companies, we will allow the public feedback system within Dunces to Dragons to give valuable resume-building stats which they can add to their resume or LinkedIn accounts.
